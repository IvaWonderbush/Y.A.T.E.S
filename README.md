# Y.A.T.E.S

[Y.A.T.E.S](http://www.thomasyates.nl/docs) is a Lua administration tool created for the game Counter-Strike 2D. It focuses mainly on the task to help server owners to administrate their server, it also provides every source to build upon without (hopefully) breaking it. The most important thing that makes Y.A.T.E.S stand out is the fact that every player or group data can be modified in-game and each player or group may also be given individual rights dynamically. The server owner may also reload the scripts without them either breaking or the server having to fully restart. For a full list of great things this tool provides; too bad - I have not had time yet :p

##### Keep in mind!
If you are here early without me having announced this project on Unreal Software, cool! But please keep in mind that this is in acceptation and may be a bit rough on a few edges. In any case, enjoy yourself!
