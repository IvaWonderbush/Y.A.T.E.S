	WARNING:
	Do not touch the _PLAYERS or _GROUPS tables if you do not know how to!
	Everything player and group defined can be changed IN-GAME, so editing this is pretty pointless
	unless you want to define data if data_player or data_group cannot be loaded or are empty.
	I would advise not to do this as data_player and data_group override this data anyway.
	BE WARNED.
